This application connects to the heart rate monitor via BluetoothSmart(Bluetooth LE) and displays heart rate statistics like current BPM(beat per min) and min/max/avg over time. Device tested was an ALATech HR strap. 

To make it a bit more fun, you win diamonds as the bird reaches the diamond on the top. Increase your heart rate to make the bird fly higher! 

Here's a quick demo for the app:
